# Simple_shell
<hr>

## Description
Simple_shell is a simple command line interpreter based on the first Unix shell 'sh', created by Ken Thompson in 1971. simple_shell is intentionally minimalistic and contains functionality for only the most basic shell tasks - accepting input, parsing the input into a command and its arguments, and executing that input. Error checking is simple and follows Bash conventions.
