# Simple_shell


## Description
Simple_shell is a simple command line interpreter based on the first Unix shell 'sh', created by Ken Thompson in 1971. simple_shell is intentionally minimalistic and contains functionality for only the most basic shell tasks - accepting input, parsing the input into a command and its arguments, and executing that input. Error checking is simple and follows Bash conventions.

## Purpose
The main purpose of the ALX simple shell project is to understand:

* How a shell works
* PID and PPIDs
* How to create processes
* The three prototypes of main
* How the shell uses the PATH to find and execute programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* The EOF/"end-of-file" condition.
