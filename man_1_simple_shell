.TP
\fB Return (Exit Value) \fR

Upon termination of the simple shell program, an exit value will be set according to the status of the last command
executed. If the command ran succesfuly, the exit value will be zero (0).

.TP
\fBFORMAT OF COMMAND INPUT\fR

The simple shell can work in two different modes, \fIinteractive\fR and \fInon-interactive\fR. In both modes, commands can be written with their absolute path or simply their executable name if they exist in one of the folders defined by PATH.

Example:

\fB/bin/ls\fR is the same as \fBls\fR (ls exists in one of the PATH folders)


.IP \fB-Interactive Mode:\fR

In this condition, the shell will display a prompt ($) that will indicate that the user can provide commands by writing them
with a keyboard. In order to execute the commands the user will need to press the enter key (new line).

Each time a command is executed, the prompt will reappear and wait for a new user input.

Example:

\fBvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$\fR ./hsh

$ ls

file1 file2 dira dirb

$

In order to exit the simple shell, the user must write "exit" command and press enter or press the combination keys CTRL + D, as the CTRL + C signal is reserved only for internal script termination and it does not exit the shell.

.IP \fB-Non-interactive Mode:\fR

In this condition, the shell will run commands provided through a pipe at the moment of execution, and will not display a prompt
($) or wait for new user input:

Example:

\fBvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$\fR echo "ls" | ./hsh

file1 file2 file3 file4

\fBvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$\fR

.SH EXAMPLES
.B Interactive
       vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$ ./simple_shell
       $ ls
       file0 file1 file2
       $ echo 123
       123
       $ echo $?
       0
       $ exit
       vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$

.B Non Interactive
       vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$ echo "pwd" | ./simple_shell
       /home/vagrant/simple_shell

       vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$ echo "ls" | ./simple_shell
       file0 file1 file2
